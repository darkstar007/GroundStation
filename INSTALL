This is just a draft at the moment - it'll grow with time and might
even be useful one day.....

I suspect that this software only works with linux - as I have no Macs
or windows machines, thats probably the way it will stay unless people

The Receivers.py module needs to have pyrtlsdr
(https://github.com/roger-/pyrtlsdr) installed in order to extract

(such as frequency corrections) can be stored and correctly associated
with that dongle.

Firstly Gnuradio 3.7 needs to be installed & working. Then we need the
satellite prediction library:

Download the library from http://www.danrw.com/sgp4 (there's a link
to the github repository (https://github.com/dnwrnr/sgp4) at the bottom
of that page).
